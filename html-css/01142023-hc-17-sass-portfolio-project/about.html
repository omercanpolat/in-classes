        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated from the Department of Industrial Engineering at the Air
          Force Academy in 2004. As a first-lieutenant, I worked in junior and
          mid-level management positions (plan officer, section supervisor
          and branch manager positions) in various departments of human
          resources departments (personnel branch directorates) in air force jet
          bases Izmir and Ankara provinces. Between 2008 and 2010, I completed
          my master of science degree in "Manpower Systems Analysis" at Naval
          Postgraduate School in the USA. After 2010, I worked as a project
          officer/interviewer in the planning of recruiting
          cadets to air force officers, non-commissioned officers and civil
          servants. As a manpower planning officer, I followed up the
          production, development and implementation of the officers',
          non-commissioned officers' and civil servants' 30/10-year manpower plans
          by using statistical analysis processes (with the help of statistical
          programs such as SAP, STATA, Arena). I worked in the units of the
          TURAF Personnel Directorate such as professional development and
          career planning, continuing education and courses,
          registration/appointment/personnel rights, and coordinated meetings on
          issues related to my roles. I attended in international conferences
          and symposiums held in NATO member countries and other countries such
          as Australia, Sweden and Switzerland on topics such as "national
          security, human resources management in the armed forces" and made
          presentations on various topics. I worked as an organizer, planner,
          participant and presenter in the organization of
          national/international symposiums and conferences held throughout the
          Turkish Air Forces (TURAF). I worked as a project officer in the
          follow-up of contracted/active duty officer, non-commissioned
          officers' recruitment and contract renewal/termination procedures, the
          creation of recruiting commissions, conducting interviews and
          monitoring the judicial and administrative processes. Within the scope
          of the Life-long Education Model, I participated in various courses,
          trainings, seminars and symposiums given for professional development
          in the field of human resources. Finally, I was continuing my pilot training in Izmir, the
          2nd Main Jet Base Command. On July 8, 2018, I retired from the Air
          Force. I am currently taking courses from Clarusway Bootcamp for
          Full-Stack Developer. I am good at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React. I
          want to continue and develop my career in IT companies. I am married
          and have two daughters. I live in BalÄ±kesir,TURKEY. I am fluent in
          English.
